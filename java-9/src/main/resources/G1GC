G1 -> Garbage First, the default GC in Java 9.

Goals:
    - Low latency & throughput
    - Pause target of 200ms

Heap split into multiples regions. The size of the regions depends on the total heap size.
The region sizes can vary from 1 to 32 MB. Is a pow of 2.

Possible regions:
    - Eden: new objects
    - Survivor
    - Old
    - Humongous: object that is greater than average size.

The G1GC demon mark the heap regions with old mark and the mixed them with eden regions to build survivors collections
whose result is to free allocated spaces to more new eden regions.
